A Github action based upon Go parser and validator for [publiccode.yml](https://github.com/italia/publiccode.yml)
files.

`publiccode.yml` is an international standard for describing public software, which
should be placed at the root of Free/Libre and Open Source software repositories.

This parser performs syntactic and semantic validation according to the
[official spec](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/publiccodeyml-en/en/master/index.html).

### Examples

Include this action in your repo by creating a `.github/workflow/pcvalidation.yml`
copy and edit where needed:

```yml
on: [push]

jobs:
  hello_world_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: publiccode validation
    steps:
    - name: publiccode validation process
      id: pcvalidation
      uses: actions/publiccode-parser-action@v0.0.1
      with:
        publiccode: 'publiccode.yml' # relative path to your publiccode.yml
    # Use the output from the `pcvalidation` step
    - name: Get the output time
      run: echo "Validation ${{ steps.pcvalidation.outputs.validation }}"

```
