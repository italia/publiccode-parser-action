A GitHub action based upon the [Go parser and validator](https://github.com/italia/publiccode-parser-go)
for [publiccode.yml](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml) files.

`publiccode.yml` is an international standard for describing public software, which
should be placed at the root of Free/Libre and Open Source software repositories.

This parser performs syntactic and semantic validation according to the
[official spec](https://yml.publiccode.tools).
